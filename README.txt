THIS IS MY NOTES AND MY THOUGHT PROCESS

What needs to happen first:
Get numeral as a string - X
Split numerals into chars - X
Translate chars into ints - X
sum the ints and print results - X

Phase two:
Figure out subtraction - X
Allow the user to input another number - X

Phase three:
Validate all inputs and reject improper input (without breaking)

Phase four:
Make the app pretty


Improper inputs:
-Spaces - x
-Characters not in the list - x
-Characters that aren't allowed to lead (listed in step 4)
-Too many characters in a row (not listed in directions, but nice)
