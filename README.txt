THESE ARE MY NOTES

Decimal to Roman
What needs to happen first:
Get numeral as a string - X
Split numerals into chars - X
Translate chars into ints - X
sum the ints and print results - X

Phase two:
Figure out subtraction - X
Allow the user to input another number - X

Phase three:
Validate all inputs and reject improper input (without breaking)

Phase four:
Make the app pretty - x


Improper inputs:
-Spaces - x
-Characters not in the list - x
-Characters that aren't allowed to lead (listed in step 4)

Characters that aren't allowed to lead
-50 and 500
-Must go biggest to largest
-Can't go out of order
-Can I cheat and just call my other function to verify? Slow if we automated this thing, but may be okay with manual entry


Roman to Decimal
-Convert to Int - x
-Verify that the int is within range - x
-figure out how to convert to letters without exceeding the allowed number of letters in a row (start with biggest or smallest?) - x
-Make the app pretty

TIME SPENT ON PROJECT
